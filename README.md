# TF & URDF STUDY GIT

## Why Made This Repo?
Recently, I joined a club called Auturbo which is Robot club. 
I feel there are so many people who are engaging in robot buissness.
But I'm not a working person so I think I need to study harder then them
So I made this repo and it is a START of my ROS gits.
I will keep making other repos
